## Web3 Advertising Protocol

DecentraAds is basically a web3 implementation of Google Ads. DecentraAds is a decentralized advertisement protocol that anyone can integrate on their dapp and start generating revenue from it. DecentraAds connects dapps with advertisers in a decentralized way. The ads listed on DecentraAds are approved by the community (depends upon DApp choice), this filters out bad products ( Unhealthy / Environmentally harmful / Frauds ) and gives good products a chance to highlight, this way our protocol helps in environment change and overall healthy internet advertisement industry. DecentraAds focuses on spreading awareness on climate change and healthy lifestyle and provides a decentralized platform to promote such good products / projects.

## What problem/challenges does DecentraAds address?

### DApp and Community Approved Ads:
DecentraAds protocol allows the dapp to decide which ad will be shown on the dapp unlike Google ads where you can lose users because of annoying and inappropriate ads and cannot decide which ad to accept and which ad to reject.
Ads by DecentraAds are approved by the community which will ensure only the good products / projects are being advertised and promoted.
-  **Privacy** : Advertisers track users and sell their data to third parties. Around 43% internet users use Ad Blockers. Reasons for using Ad Blockers are privacy concerns and bad ads.
-  **Unhealthy products** : Advertisers promote unhealthy products like cigarettes, alcohol, junk food, etc.
-  **Uncontrolled Ads** : Apps don’t have the control to select which ads to endorse and reject, resulting in bad user-experience and losing user base.

### Decentralization of Internet Advertisements:
One of the main characteristics of web3 is decentralization, the transfer of control and decision-making from a centralized entity to a distributed network that's what DecentraAds is aiming to achieve.
-  **High Platform Fees** : Google and other giants takes a big chunk from the revenue generated from ads.
  
### Financial Support for Useful DApps:
Most web3 projects are very useful but lack a business model when dapps need financial support on start or on the point where they need it, that's why they don’t survive or never get built in the first place. These projects can rely on DecentraAds to generate revenue. 

### Financial Incentive for Users/DAO:

“If you're not paying for the product, then you're the product.”

The above saying basically explains how advertising works on the internet, the users watching ads are the source of revenue for the app, there is nothing wrong with that but DecentraAds allow users to take a small part of the marketing budget by reviewing the ads.

### Low Fees:
DecentraAds takes a very low protocol fee from the revenue generated from ads, this will help dapps to generate more revenue and users to get more rewards.

### Transparency:
DecentraAds is a transparent protocol, all the transactions are visible on the blockchain, this will ensure that the protocol is not being manipulated by any party. All the particpants can see the deals made between advertisers and dapps.
